/*

To upload the arduino sketch, use 'sensor_w_turn_around_1.ino' from the self-titled library.  

To connect the Bluetooth real-time mapping, download 'Car.py', 'Mapping.py', 'Serial_Communication.py', and 'Value_Functions.py'. 

The file 'Serial_Communication.py' serves as the main file and should be called in terminal to begin Bluetooth programming.

The rest of the files are temporary tests that weren't used in the final build.
